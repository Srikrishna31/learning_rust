/// Safe Rust code cannot trigger a data race, a specific kind of bug where multiple thread read and
/// write the same memory concurrently, producing meaningless results.
/// However, threads that use mutexes are subject to some other problems that Rust doesn't fix for you:
/// * Valid Rust programs can't have data races, but they can still have other race conditions - situations
/// where a program's behavior depends on timing among threads and may therefore vary from run to run.
/// Some race conditions are benign. Some manifest as general flakiness and incredibly hard-to-fix bugs.
/// Using mutexes in an unstructured way invites race conditions. It's upto you to make sure they're
/// benign.
/// * Shared mutable state also affects program design. Mutexes encourage a "just-add-a-method" way of
/// working that can lead to a monolithic blob of interrelated code.
/// * Mutexes are just not as simple as they seem.
///
/// A thread can deadlock itself by trying to acquire a lock that it's already holding. To put it another
/// way, the lock in a Mutex is not a recursive lock. There are other ways to get deadlock, too, involving
/// multiple threads that each acquire multiple mutexes at once. Rust's borrow system can't protect
/// you from deadlock. The best protection is to keep critical sections small: get in, do your work and
/// get out.
/// It's also possible to get a deadlock with channels. For example, two threads might block each one
/// waiting to receive a message from the other. However, again, good program design can give you high
/// confidence that this won't happen in practice.
///
/// Poisoned Mutexes
/// If a thread panics while holding a Mutex, Rust marks the Mutex as poisoned. Any subsequent attempt
/// to lock the poisoned Mutex will get an error result.
/// The reason mutexes are poisoned on panic is not for fear of undefined behavior. Rather, the concern
/// is that you've probably been programming with invariants. Since your program panicked and bailed
/// out of a critical section without finishing what it was doing, perhaps having updated some fields
/// of the protected data but not others, it's possible that the invariants are now broken. Rust poisons
/// the mutex to prevent other threads from blundering unwittingly into this broken situation and
/// making it worse. You can still lock a poisoned mutex and access the data inside, with mutual exclusion
/// fully enforced. But you won't do it by accident.
///
/// Multiconsumer Channels using Mutexes
/// We can add a Mutex around a Receiver and share it to make it multiconsumer channel
